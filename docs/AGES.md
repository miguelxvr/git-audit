## AGES Methodology and Practices

### Agile Framework

AGES teams follow Agile/Scrum practices:
- **Sprint-based development**: Iterative delivery cycles
- **Regular ceremonies**:
  - Daily Standup (Reunião Rápida)
  - Sprint Planning
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- **Continuous documentation**: Wiki-based knowledge management
- **Version control**: Git for all code artifacts

### Quality Assurance

- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory for AGES III students
- **Functional Testing**: Required from AGES I level
- **Verification & Validation**: Led by AGES III students
- **Documentation Standards**: Wiki pages for all project artifacts

### Knowledge Sharing

- **Mentorship model**: Senior students support junior students
  - AGES IV supports AGES I, II, and III
  - AGES III supports AGES I and II
  - AGES II supports AGES I
- **Collaborative development**: Multiple levels work together on projects
- **Documentation focus**: All knowledge captured in Wiki

## Typical Team Composition

A complete AGES project team typically includes:
